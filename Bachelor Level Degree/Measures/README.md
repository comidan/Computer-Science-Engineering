# Measures

## Topics

### The measure and the main metrological characteristics
- Accuracy, uncertainty, resolution, sensitivity, repeatability, traceability, etc. The international system of units (SI), SI rules and symbols, various types of samples. Definitions and operations on logarithmic units (dB, dBm, dBc, Np). Essential blocks of a measuring system. Characteristics of the signals (continuous and discrete in amplitude and time, periodic, aperiodic) and parameters of interest (average, effective, peak value).
Elements of statistics and measurement uncertainty. Meaning of mean value, variance, variance of the mean value and number of degrees of freedom. The best estimate of the measurement result and statistical uncertainty estimated through the dispersion of the results (Cat. A) or with other methods (Cat. B). Estimate of uncertainty in direct measurements. Error propagation and uncertainty calculation in indirect measurements. Statistical independence and correlation. Compatibility between measurements and weighed averages. Reliability elements.

### The representation of experimental results
- Cartesian and polar diagrams. Linear and logarithmic scales. Interpolation and regression of experimental data.

### Digital instrumentation
- Sampling and analog / digital (A / D) conversion. Digital voltmeters and multimeters: quantization error, resolution, number of bits and number of digits in an A / D converter. Equivalent bits. Examples of differential voltmeters (successive approximations and flash). Integration principle and dual ramp integrator voltmeter.

### Data acquisition systems
- Acquisition cards. LabVIEW programming language and virtual instruments (VI). Communication protocols between instruments (RS232, IEEE488 and USB). During the laboratory exercises the programming fundamentals of the LabVIEW language will be approached and what learned will be directly verified through the preparation of measurement experiments based on data acquisition cards. The problems connected with the conditioning and processing of the measurement signal will be experimented.

### Basic instrumentation for measurements
- Digital oscilloscope: sampling in real time and in equivalent time; advanced trigger mode; automatic measurements. Examples of measurements with the oscilloscope (amplitude, phase, frequency, rise time, etc.). Spectrum analyzer: analog systems for simultaneous and sequential analysis, digital instruments with numerical analysis (FFT). Frequency resolution and sensitivity of a spectrum analyzer.

### Laboratory activities
- The laboratory activities are experimental with the aim of familiarizing students with the SW programs for acquiring signals and quantities from the external analog world. The laboratory aims to initiate the student's education in the use of modern digital measuring instruments. In particular, the programming fundamentals of the LabVIEW language will be mentioned and put into practice: what has been learned will be directly verified through the preparation of measurement experiments, on electronic components and circuits, carried out by means of data acquisition cards. The problems connected with the conditioning and processing of the measurement signal will be experimented. Students will also have the opportunity to try their hand at measuring instruments (digital voltmeters, function generators, digital oscilloscopes, and spectrum analyzers) for the characterization of electrical and electronic signals. Each student can carry out 8 laboratory hours divided into 2 exercises (4 hours each). The calendar of laboratory exercises will be published on the WEB page www.elet.polimi.it/corsi/labgolgi. The organizational details relating to the laboratory activities and the corresponding assessments will be presented as an exercise and in any case made available on the Course's WEB page.
