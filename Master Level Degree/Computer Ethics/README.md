# Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming
## Main lectures topics:


The course will cover different topics both from and theoretical and a more practical point of
view. We will start with a broad analysis of the concept of responsibility, in particular in an
engineering perspective, and of normative ethics and its tools. We will introduce codes of
conduct with a detailed discussion about the ACM and IEEE Codes. We will discuss ethical
questions in the design of technology with a focus on Design Ethics and its Social Ethics
paradigm. Then ethics in IT-configured societies will be discussed and technology as
the instrumentation of human action will be presented. Within this context we will focus:
on information flow, privacy, and surveillance, on digital intellectual property and on
digital order. Finally the ethical cycle will be presented as a tool to analyze and solve illstructured ethical problems.
