# Model Identification and Data Analysis 2

## Topics

### Non-parametric system identification: the subspace-based state-space approach
### Kalman Filter: prediction, virtual-sensing and gray-box system identification
### Analysis and design of closed-loop systems using the minimum-variance approach
### Non-linear system-identification: parametric nonlinear fitting; N-ARMAX models; optimal design of basis functions using Principal-Component-Analysis
### Frequency domain parametric identification of models from data
### Recursive system identification: extension of system-identification to time-varying systems
