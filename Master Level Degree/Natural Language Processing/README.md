# Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming
## Main lectures topics:


- Introduction.

- Mind models and linguistic / expressive / interactive competencies:

    - Development of expressive competencies, by means of verbal (both written and spoken), iconic, and gestural languages.
    - Linguistic competencies and the act of thinking.
    - Language, pragmatics, and interaction.
    - Natural language representation: levels and their complexity: computational linguistics as a representation of human linguistic competencies, as a model, and as a solution to specific and well defined problems.

- Roles of symbolic and stochastic models in: morphologic, syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic analysis; sentiment analysis; spoken language, phonologic, and prosodic analysis; linguistic prediction; complexity evaluation; pattern recognition.

- Trends in research and development: model composition and integration; definition of different criteria for model selection and composition/integration, given a language representation and a problem to cope with.

- Models and techniques for written natural language processing.

- Morphologic analysis and ambiguity resolution: lexicons, corpora and dictionaries.

- Syntactic and structural analysis:

    - Symbolic approaches
    - Stochastic approaches
    - Hybrid approaches

- Semantic and discourse analysis: using integrated approaches; analysis of different representation levels.

- Models and techniques for spoken natural language processing.

- Components and characteristics of vocal expression and interaction: feature extraction, classification of vocal characteristics, voice profile definition, vocal expression and interaction model.

- Models for the description of: tone and prosody, time scheduling, forms, interactions, and complex dialogues, expressivity.

- Human-machine and human-human interaction.

- Analysis and elaboration of linguistic-expressive resources on the net.

- Supporting the analysis of communication and dialogue.

- Supporting text authoring with prediction and summarization.

- Supporting text complexity analysis.

- Supporting speech and prosodic analysis.

- Supporting sentiment analysis in critical interaction.

- High quality text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition (ASR). Analysis strategies and models for advanced components in both TTS and ASR.

- Defining linguistic user profiles for verbal (both written and spoken) languages.

- Deep Learing approaches for ASR, TTS, embeddings representations, features extraction and all NLP tasks.
