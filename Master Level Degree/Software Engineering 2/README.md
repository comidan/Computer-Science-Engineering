- The objective of the project is to help students in applying the approaches and principles that are taught in class. Projects will be assigned at the beginning of the semester. Project artifacts (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document and Design Document) are expected to be released at fixed deadlines that will be defined by the time the project will be assigned. The evaluation of projects will be based on the produced artifacts and on a presentation. The project laboratory will include class discussions supervised by the course instructor.
