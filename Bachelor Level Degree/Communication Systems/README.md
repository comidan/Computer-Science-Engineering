# Communication Systems

## Topics

### Definition of communication system
- Characteristics of information signals and disturbances.

### Thermal noise
- Characterization of apparatus and systems with regard to noise.

### Baseband transmission
- Pulse transmission: inter-symbolic interference (Nyquist criterion) and reception in the presence of noise (adapted filter). WFP transmission and performance calculation. Gray coding.

### Numerical transmission of analog signals
- Coded impulse modulation (PCM). Transmission of PCM signals. Multiplexing techniques.

### Broadband transmission
- Introduction to analogue modulations of amplitude (AM) and angle (PM, FM). Block diagrams and features. Low pass equivalent of band pass signals. Linear numerical modulations (ASK, QAM, PSK); signal space and performance (union bound); FSK modulation. Performance in presence of white Gaussian additive noise (AWGN channel). Comparison between modulation systems.

### Effects of the characteristics of the transmission medium and noise. Multi-carrier transmission (OFDM).

### Multi-section systems (regenerative / non-regenerative)

### Transmission media (guided and radiated waves).

### Design criteria and sizing of a communication system. Notes on diversity techniques.

### Basic limits for the transmission of information. Channel capacity (Shannon). Source encoding.
