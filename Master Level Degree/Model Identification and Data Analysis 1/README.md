# Model Identification and Data Analysis 1

## Topics

### Basic concepts of stochastic processes
- Laws and models in engineering and science. Uncertainty. Estimation problems from experimental data (examples from different subject areas). Accuracy of the models and their complexity. Models for classification, prediction, control, simulation and management. Data processing techniques
### ARMA and ARMAX classes of parametric models for time series and for Input/Output systems
- Time series input / output models and cause / effect relationships (AR, MA, ARMA, ARX, ARMAX, ARIMAX models). State models. Correlation analysis and spectral analysis. Prediction methods starting from input / output models (Kolmogorov-Wiener theory).
### Parameter identification of ARMA and ARMAX models
- Problems and estimation techniques. Identification from simple experimental tests. Identification with Least Squares and Maximum Verisimilitude. Identification of AR, MA, ARMA, ARMAX models. Choice of complexity (FPE, AIC, MDL criteria). Yule-Walker equations and Durbin-Levinson algorithm. Spectral and frequency estimation. Use of ARX and ARMAX models in predictive control
### Analysis of identification methods
### Model validation and pre-processing
