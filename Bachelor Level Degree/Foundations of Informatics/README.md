# Foundations of Informatics

## Topics

### Introductory concepts
- Algorithms, programs and languages
- General structure of a computer and an IT system (hardware, software, operating system)
- Programming chain.

### Logic and binary coding of information
- propositional logic, logical operators AND, OR, NOT, De Morgan's laws
- representation of integers (base 2, 16, complementary notation at base 2)
- binary arithmetic
- representation of real numbers (fixed and floating point notation)
- character encoding.

### Fundamental aspects of programming (with reference to the C language)
- the programming language and the needs for abstraction
- the syntax, structure of a single-module program
- abstraction on data (concept of type and basic types of language, operators and compatibility, manufacturers array, struct, pointers)
- abstraction on execution control (conditional, selection, iterative control structures)

### Subroutines
- subroutines as an abstraction for the modular realization of programs
- parameter transfer, local data, visibility rules
- top down development for refinement
- recursion
- run-time support for call management and return from subprogram (activation record, stack and stack pointer).

### Dynamic data structures, lists linked to pointers.

### Persistent data structures
- files (concepts, operations, logical organization)
- integration between data structures in central memory and on file.
