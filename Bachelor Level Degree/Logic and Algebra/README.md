# Logic and Algebra

## Topics

### RELATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
- Relations, with particular regard to binary relationships on a whole. Product of relations. Binary relations properties: seriality, reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, antisymmetry. Closures of a relations with respect to a given set of properties.
- Equivalence relations and applications. Concepts of quotient set, of application kernels, factorization theorems of an application. Cardinality of a set and Cantor theorem.
- Order relationships, lattices as ordered sets.
- Internal and external operations, ownership of operations. Unit and inverse of an element with respect to a binary operation.

### PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC
- The language of the logic of propositions, syntactically correct formulas. Evaluation of a formula, tautologies and contradictions. Deduction and semantic equivalence. Normal disjunctive and conjunctive forms.
- Formal systems. L theory, deduction theorems, correctness and completeness, decidability. Resolution and refinements.

### LOGIC OF THE ORDER
- The language of first-order predicative calculus, syntactically correct terms and formulas. Free and constrained variables. Closed formulas. Evaluation of a formula: the concept of interpretation. Satisfactory, true, false formulas in an interpretation. Logically valid formulas. Normal form prenessa, form of Skolem.
- Formal systems: notes on K theory and resolution.
- First order theories and first order theories with identity.
- Models of a theory.
- Deduction, correctness and completeness theorems. Decidability issues.

### ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES
- The main algebraic structures: semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, bodies, fields (definitions and examples).
- Substructures, related criteria.
- Congruence relationships, quotient structures. The congruence relation modulo n and hints of modular arithmetic
- Similar structures, homomorphisms and isomorphisms between similar structures, the kernel of a homomorphism and the factorization theorem of homomorphisms.
