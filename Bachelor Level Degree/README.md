# Bachelor level degree in Computer Science Engineering

These are all the courses I've taken at Politecnico di Milano for this Engineering degree, all the material and topics are available for each topic to give you an idea of what it's learned during this engineering course at this unversity.

## DISCLAIMER:
Being an italian university, the Bachelor courses and related material are mostly in italian language.
Instead, the MSc courses and materials are provided in english and so available more easily to anyone.
