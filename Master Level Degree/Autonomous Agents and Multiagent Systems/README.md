# Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming
## Main lectures topics:


- Introduction to the concepts of autonomous agents and of multiagent systems.

- Autonomous agents as rational decision makers: architecture for intelligent agents, Markov decision processes.

- Interactions between self-interested agents: short introduction to game theory, negotiations, voting mechanisms, auctions, coalition formation.

- Interactions between cooperative agents: decision-theoretic multiagent planning, distributed constraint optimization.

- Multiagent learning: multiagent Markov decision processes and stochastic games, evolutionary game theory.

- Examples of real-world applications of agent-based systems.
