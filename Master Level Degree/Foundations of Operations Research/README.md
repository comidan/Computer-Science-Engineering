# Foundations of Operations Research

## Topics

### Introduction

- Decision-making problems. Main steps of an O.R. study. Different types of optimization (mathematical programming) problems. Optimization models (decision variables, objective function, constraints) and modeling techniques.

### Graph and network optimization

- Optimum spanning trees. Shortest path problems: algorithms for the main variants (including Dynamic programming for acyclic graphs). Application to project scheduling: critial path method and Gantt diagrams. Maximum flows: Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and maximum flow-minimum cut theorem. Minimum cost flows, matching in bipartite graphs.  

### Basics of computational complexity

- Recognition problems, classes P and NP, NP-complete and NP-hard problems. Traveling salesman problem, Integer Linear Programming and other examples.

### Linear Programming (LP)

- LP models. Geometric aspects (vertices of the feasible region) and algebraic aspects (basic feasible solutions). Fundamental properties of linear programming. The Simplex method. LP duality theory: pair of dual problems, weak and strong duality, complementary slackness conditions. Economic interpretation. Sensitivity analysis. Special cases: assignment and transportation problems.

### Integer Linear Programming (ILP)

- ILP models for, among others, transportation, routing, scheduling and location problems. Formulations and linear programming relaxation. Exact methods: Branch-and-Bound algorithm, cutting plane method with fractional Gomory cuts. 
- Time permitting: introduction to heuristic algorithms (greedy and local search).
