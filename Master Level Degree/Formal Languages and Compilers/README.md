# Formal Languages and Compilers

## Topics

- Definition of language, theory of formal languages, regular expressions, context-free grammars,
ambiguity, grammars of regular (rational) languages, syntax trees, properties of the families
of regular (rational) and context-free languages, main syntactic structures and limitations
of the context-free languages.
- Analysis and recognition (parsing) of phrases, phrase recognition algorithms (parsing algorithms)
and automata, finite deterministic and non-deterministic automata, pushdown automata, deterministic
languages, ascending and recursive descending syntactic analysis, and Earley parsing algorithm.
- Syntax-driven translation, direct and inverse translation, language homomorphim and substitution,
syntactic translation schemata, transducer automata, and syntactic analysis and translation.
- Semantic translation driven by syntax, semantic functions and attribute grammars, hints to compiler
structure and design, examples of sematic check and translation, one-pass and multiple-pass computation
of the attributes.
- Static flow analysis of programs.

- Modelisation of the lexicon and the syntax of a simple programming language (C-like).
- Design of a compiler for translation into an intemediate executable machine language (for a register-based processor).
- Use of the automated programming tools Flex and Bison for the construction of syntax-driven
lexical and syntactic analysers and translators.
- Construction of a basic compiler
