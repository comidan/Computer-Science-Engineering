# Advanced Algorithms and Parallel Programming
## Main lectures topics:


The course is composed by a set of lectures on autonomous robotics, ranging from the main architectural patterns in mobile robots and autonomous vehicles to the description of sensing and planning algorithms for autonomous navigation. The course outline is:

- Mobile robots kinematics,
- Sensors and perception,
- Robot localization and map building,
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM),
- Path planning and collision avoidance,
- Robot development via ROS

Lectures will provide theoretical background as well as real-world examples; these will be complemented with practical exercises in simulation for all the proposed topics and the students will be guided in developing the algorithms to control an autonomous robot using ROS, the Robot Operating System (http://www.ros.org/).

The slides from all the lectures will be available on the course website (http://chrome.ws.dei.polimi.it/index.php/Robotics) together with a detailed schedule of the classes, links to relevant papers, and online resources.
